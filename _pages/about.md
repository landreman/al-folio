title="A quasisymmetric stellarator: a magnetic field with a hidden symmetry that enables confinement of charged particles. Black lines indicate magnetic field lines. Color indicates the magnetic field strength."/>
We are a research group at the Insitute for Research in Electronics & Applied Physics,
at the University of Maryland, College Park, MD.
The central theme of our <a href="research">research</a> is the role of symmetry
in magnetized plasmas.
We carry out research in plasma physics using both theory and high-performance computing.
Much of the group's work concerns the 
[stellarator]({{ site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}/projects/1_stellarators) (shown above), a plasma trap that uses magnetic fields
with carefully designed shaping. 
The stellarator is a candidate configuration for fusion energy,
as well as a general charged particle trap.
We are part of the <a href="https://ireap.umd.edu/research/theory">plasma theory
group</a> at Maryland.

We are located in<br>
